This is what I do when sheltering in place. Nothing like doing more coding when you are done with the coding you do for work.

The scripts make a number of plots of the time histories of COVID19, using data from the Johns Hopkins repo
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) plus other data gathered from else where.

This was done entirely for my own personal interest and the plots should not be used for any official purpose.
